# Objectos Way In A Single File

Source code for the "Objectos Way In A Single File" video series,
where we'll develop a full Objectos Way application contained in a single Java source file.

Of course, in regular development, you'd most likely structure your Objectos Way project around multiple classes and, if that's your thing, multiple packages.
But we hope to show that "full-stack" web development in Java can (and should) be simpler. 

## How to Run

To run the latest iteration of the application, you'll need:

- JDK 23 or later.

Then, in a work directory, run the following commands:

```
wget -q https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/br/com/objectos/objectos.way/0.2.2/objectos.way-0.2.2.jar
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectos/demo.sf/refs/heads/main/main/Start.java
java -p objectos.way-0.2.2.jar --add-modules objectos.way --enable-preview Start.java
```

Finally, browse to `http://localhost:8080`.

Alternatively, you can run a previous iteration of the application by following the instructions on the relevant section below.

## Iterations

This section lists all the iterations of the application in reverse chronological order.

### OWIASF #002: HTML response using the `Html.Template` class 

We improve on the previous iteration,
and we replace the text response "home page" with an HTML page generated by a `Html.Template` instance. 

Requires JDK 23 or later.
Instructions to run:

```
wget -q https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/br/com/objectos/objectos.way/0.2.2/objectos.way-0.2.2.jar
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectos/demo.sf/refs/tags/v002/main/Start.java
java -p objectos.way-0.2.2.jar --add-modules objectos.way --enable-preview Start.java
```

After the server starts:

- Browse to `http://localhost:8080` and it see the response generated by the `Start.Home` class.
- Browse to any other path and it responds with "Not Found".

### OWIASF #001: Single-Path Text-Response Web Server 

Configures and starts the web server:

- Browse to `http://localhost:8080` and it responds with "It Works!".
- Browse to any other path and it responds with "Not Found".

Requires JDK 23 or later.
Instructions to run:

```
wget -q https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/br/com/objectos/objectos.way/0.2.2/objectos.way-0.2.2.jar
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectos/demo.sf/refs/tags/v001/main/Start.java
java -p objectos.way-0.2.2.jar --add-modules objectos.way --enable-preview Start.java
```

After the server starts, browse to `http://localhost:8080`.
